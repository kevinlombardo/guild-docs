# CI/CD Pipeline
Fortifying delivery with automation and integrity.

## Purpose
The Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is the spine of modern software delivery. In the Guild's view, it must embody repeatability, scalability, and simplicity over cleverness. Automation exists not merely for speed, but for safety, auditability, and resilience.

## Pipeline Overview

A CI/CD Pipeline shall consist of discrete, automated stages that transform developer intent into safely deployed artifacts.

### Stages and Principles

Build Automation: Determinism over configuration

Test Automation: Safety as code - manual, layered testing 

Deployment: Predictable delivery through progressive delivery

Elease: Traceable change management with controlled promotion, rollback, and audit trails.

## Build Automation
Patterns for deterministic artifact creation.

## Test Automation
Safety nets as code: unit, integration, contract, and performance gates.

## Deployment Strategies
immutable delivery patterns - blue/green, canary, and progressive rollout.

## Release Management
Controlled promotion, rollback safety, and traceable releases.

## Pipeline Observability
Visibility over every stage. Failures must be actionable. Success must be verifiable.

## Governance and Compliance
Pipelines are infrastructure. Compliance is automated policy. Manual gates only when mandated.

- Policy as code
- Security scans integrated in the pipeline
- Artifact attestation and verification
