# Cost Model

cost_model:
  gpt_token_costs:
    description: GPT-4 Turbo pricing as of 2025
    input: "$0.01 per 1K tokens"
    output: "$0.03 per 1K tokens"
    example_interaction:
      input_tokens: 500
      output_tokens: 1500
      estimated_cost: "$0.05"

  deployment_guild_usage:
    light_usage: "$20–50/month — mostly manual workflows, few GPT calls"
    medium_usage: "$50–150/month — daily use of GPTs for doc writing and review"
    heavy_usage: "$200+/month — full GPT-GPT automation and large-scale content"

  api_and_hosting_costs:
    github: "Free for public repos, or $4/user for Pro"
    vps_server: "$5–20/month for self-hosted API gateway"
    google_docs_api: "Free within Google API quotas"
    storage: "$1–5/month if storing generated docs or logs"

  guidance:
    - Use GPTs for proposal/draft generation, not full automation.
    - Prefer Git-based workflows for structured, reviewable changes.
    - Use Actions sparingly or batch changes to reduce token cost.
    - Consider caching results or PR gating for frequent calls.
