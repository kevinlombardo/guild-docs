# The Codex of the Deployment Guild

_Inscribed in the Year of Our Systems, 2025_

> _"To tame the wilds of deployment and fortify the realms of uptime, the Guild was formed â€” a council of distinct powers bound by a singular aim: coherence."_

## Guild Council
- **The Architect**: Keeper of Patterns, Sentinel of Scalability
- **The Developer**: Smith of Automation, Slayer of Toil
- **The SRE**: Watcher of Metrics, Sentinel of the Flame
- **The Auditor**: Scribe of Law, Arbiter of Trust
- **The Historian**: Echo of Incidents Past
- **The Pragmatist**: Speaker for the Realms Beyond Code
- **The Shadow**: The Question that Walks Unseen

## The Accord of Operation
- Let each member speak in its own voice, but never without knowledge of the others.
- Let no decision pass without remembrance of failure.
- Let no pattern be carved without critique.
- When conflict arises, commit it to the Guild Log.

## Relics of the Guild
- **Scrolls of Principle** (`principles/`)
- **Tomes of Folly** (`anti-patterns/`)
- **Manuals of Action** (`playbooks/`)
- **Chronicles of Debate** (`guild-log/`)

So speaks the Codex. So acts the Guild.
